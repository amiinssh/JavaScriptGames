## üíª Code Overview

### HTML Structure

```html
<h2>Computer choice: <span id="computer-choice"></span></h2>
<h2>User choice: <span id="user-choice"></span></h2>
<h2>Result: <span id="result"></span></h2>

<button id="rock">rock</button>
<button id="paper">paper</button>
<button id="scissors">scissors</button>
```
- **`span` elements**: Used to dynamically display computer choice, user choice, and the result.
- **Buttons**: Three buttons allow the user to select "rock," "paper," or "scissors."

### JavaScript Logic

- Randomly generates the computer's choice.
- Compares the player's choice and computer's choice.
- Determines the result based on the rules:
   - **Rock beats Scissors**  
   - **Scissors beat Paper**  
   - **Paper beats Rock**  
   - Identical choices result in a **DRAW**.

### Example JavaScript Snippet

```javascript
function generateComputerChoice() {
  const randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3) + 1;

  if (randomNumber === 1) computerChoice = "rock";
  if (randomNumber === 2) computerChoice = "paper";
  if (randomNumber === 3) computerChoice = "scissors";

  computerChoiceDisplay.innerHTML = computerChoice;
}
```
